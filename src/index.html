			<p class="a1a">The Vaganova method demands a strong technical foundation. technically correct movement is the starting point for losing oneself in the dance. Technique and joy and are equally important. Without the ability to express the joy of the movement, technique
				is meaningless. For dancers who prefer to dance for fun or exercise, her focus is to give them the technical grounding and expertise so that they can enjoy movement and express themselves through the dance. Alisa’s dream is to create a wonderful environment
				for both vocational and recreational dancers where their personalities and talents flourish. Dance as a tool for self-development is something Alisa is passionate about. Watching her students of all ages flourish is the ultimate reward. To help build
				confidence, skill, co-ordination, and self-expression, a nurturing body-positive environment is essential. Incorporating fun into classes is also important.</p>

			<p class="a1a">Exams are not compulsory but highly recommended. Exams help to build student confidence, and they are assessed by an independent professional teacher, resulting in important feedback and training recommendations.
				<br /><br /> Exams also serve as a great motivational tool for students to work harder on their class routines.<br /> The examiner’s mark decides whether the student has passed the level and can advance or if they should stay in the same level.
				<br /><br /> If a student does not participate in the examination, his/her regular teacher will decide whether the student will advance or not.</p>

				<span id="fvaganova" class="ctrlforthm">></span>
			</div>
			<p class="a1a">The Vaganova Method is a ballet technique and training system devised by the Russian dancer and pedagogue Agrippina Vaganova (1879–1951). While there is debate over which system is the best, simply put most of the worlds best dancers of the last and
				current century were trained in the Vaganova method. A good dancer can come come out of any system and no ballet company hires only Vaganova or RAD, or Cecchetti graduates.</p>
			<p class="a2a article">Vaganova’s key strengths are; teaching correct movement and posture first, strict technique based on correct movement and very clear grading and marking systems. Many RAD & Cecchetti dancers need to unlearn or improve their technique upon entering
				the professional dance world.
				<br /><br /> Vaganova graduates are arguably more ready for the rigours of professional dancing.
				<br /><br /> From a parent’s perspective Vaganova may seem the better choice as the risk of injury is lower and assessments of the student’s progress are more accurate as the balance between technical ability and expression is more objectively obvious.</p>
			<p class="a3a article">For dancers starting at a later age ( 5-7 years of age is normal) Vaganova method is a good choice as they will be immersed in correct technique allowing their natural ability to flourish faster.
				<br /><br /> Recreational dancers who dance purely for fun or exercise will benefit from a system of movement that reduces injury risk and quickly benefits endurance, posture and strength.</p>
